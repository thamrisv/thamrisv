    <h2> About Me (click to open)</h2>
  </summary> 
<p>
I am a University of Kansas senior majoring in Information Systems. My passion for diverse experiences spans coding, art, Astro/photography, and music, reflecting my belief in the power of a multifaceted skill set.

Throughout my academic journey, I've embraced various roles, from being a Teaching Assistant at the University of Kansas to contributing as a multimedia committee member at VIA-1. Additionally, I have held five different board positions within campus clubs and organizations, where I've honed my event organization skills and learned to identify and cultivate leadership qualities.

My career aspirations are global, fueled by a curiosity and passion for international business. This global mindset was reinforced during my internship as a Junior Account Executive at Delvify Ads in Hong Kong. Living and working in Hong Kong for two months, I immersed myself in the world of programmatic advertising, gaining invaluable interpersonal skills and forming connections with professionals from around the globe.

My diverse heritage—Malaysian, Indonesian, and Chinese—has instilled in me an appreciation for the richness of global cultures. This background drives my desire to experience as much of the world as possible, both personally and professionally. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my multicultural insights and technical skills to make a meaningful impact in the global arena.

I am always eager to embrace new opportunities and continuously expand my skillset, driven by a passion for lifelong learning and growth.
